							Blackberry, cassis, graphite, turned loam and leather. Just a bit of a lavender and herb
							note. Palate: This is rich in the mouth, but less so than the Bryant. Giving black fruit in
							layers, and nice floral and gravel notes in between. Finish: Penetrating black fruit notes,
							cigar, loam and lavender. <br><br>I loved the fresh garden notes that intertwine with the
							sweet fruit here. It is culty, but the Ric Forman influence can be seen as it has the most

							Great gamy nose full of black fruit and earthy tones, with pencil shavings and licorice too.
							A small amount of brett, but not at all off-putting and it actually adds to the appeal.
							Medium bodied, but super complex and with a finish that goes on for hours. Could still taste

							nicely integrated. And the fruit was pure and rich, with black cherry, blackberry, and plum
							surrounded by spice, cedar, vanilla, and fresh flowers. Full-bodied and powerful. The
							acidity was high, but in a way that created a nice freshness. While drinking extremely well

							<h3>Abreu</h3><a target='_blank' href='http://www.abreuvineyards.com/'> Producer
								website</a><br><br>Abreu Vineyards is of famed vineyard manager David Abreu. Mr. Abreu’s
							farming skills are in extremely high demand, and he oversees many of the Napa Valley’s most
							prestigious vineyard properties.<br><br>Region: Napa Valley <br>Sub Region: St Helena
							<br><br><br>David Abreu and his winemaker, Brad Grimes produce four single vineyard red
							wines under Abreu Vineyards company. The labels are; Madrona Ranch, Cappella, Thorevilos,
							and Las Posadas. There is a fifth wine which is a blend of all four properties called,
							Rothwell Hyde. Wines are available for purchase though their direct mailing list
							only.<br><br>This is a highly sought after label that is owned by vineyard
							manager-extraordinaire David Abreu, also known as, “the grower to the stars.” He has farmed
							for many illustrious estates including current and past clients such as; Colgin, Staglin,
							Bryant, Kenzo, Sloan, Marciano, Harlan Estate, and Screaming Eagle.<br><br>David Abreu, a
							third-generation rancher from St. Helena, founded Abreu Vineyards in 1980 after working
							briefly at Caymus Vineyards. That year he formed David Abreu Vineyard Management, working
							with pioneering winemaker Richard Forman to manage ranching operations at Inglenook
							Winery.<br><br>Abreu and Forman became friends and traveled frequently to Bordeaux, where
							they observed French winemaking operations. They brought back French rootstock, trellis
							designs, and Bordelais planting and farming techniques.[1]<br><br>Abreu's fame spread as
							more wineries hired David Abreu Vineyard Management company to plant and manage ranching
							operations. By 1999 he was considered the premier viticulturist for premium grapes in Napa
							Valley.[2] Abreu's company has raised grapes for some of the most respected wineries in Napa
							and Sonoma Valleys including Blankiet Estate, Acacia Vineyard, Staglin Family Vineyards,
							Jones Family Vineyards, Bressler Vineyards, Colgin Cellars, Pahlmeyer Vineyard, Sloan
							Estate, Bryant Family Vineyard, Fisher Vineyards, Oakford Vineyards, Araujo Estate Wines,
							Grace Family Vineyard, Viader Vineyards, and Harlan estate, among others.<br><br>In 1998
							eminent wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. included Abreu in his list of the "most
							influential wine personalities of the last 20 years."[3] In 2006 Abreu was hired to replant
							the Screaming Eagle Winery vineyards.[4]<br><br> <br>The wines<br>Abreu Vineyards
							concentrates exclusively on estate-grown cabernet sauvignon blends. Robert Parker gave the
							1997 Madrona Ranch cabernet perfect 100-point score, one of only 140 wines in the world to
							receive the honor.[5] In the "Judgment of Sauternes," in October, 2006 the 1997 cabernet was
							judged the #1 wine in the world by the Grand Jury Européen.[6]<br>In the late 1990s Abreu
							and Forman jointly purchased and planted the 20-acre Thorevilos Vineyard. They released
							Abreu's first cabernet from that vineyard in 2000.[7]<br>Distribution is extremely limited,
							although a number of online wine sellers do advertise Abreu wines at $100 to $600 or more
							per bottle. Production was 500 cases in 1999.<br>References<br>^ Forman (2000). Launching

							<h3>Cabernet Sauvignon</h3>Cabernet Sauvignon is probably the most famous red wine grape
							variety on Earth. It is rivaled in this regard only by its Bordeaux stablemate Merlot, and
							its opposite number in Burgundy, Pinot Noir. From its origins in Bordeaux, Cabernet has
							successfully spread to almost every winegrowing country in the world. It is now the key
							grape variety in many first-rate New World wine regions, most notably Napa Valley,
							Coonawarra and Maipo Valley. Wherever they come from, Cabernet Sauvignon wines always seem
							to demonstrate a handful of common character traits: deep color, good tannin structure,
							moderate acidity and aromas of blackcurrant, tomato leaf, dark spices and
							cedarwood.<br><br>Used as frequently in blends as in varietal wines, Cabernet Sauvignon has
							a large number of common blending partners. Apart from the obvious Merlot and Cabernet
							Franc, the most prevalent of these are Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenere (the ingredients
							of a classic Bordeaux Blend), Shiraz (in Australia's favorite blend) and in Spain and South
							America, a Cabernet – Tempranillo blend is now commonplace. Even the bold Tannat-based wines
							of Madiran are now generally softened with Cabernet Sauvignon<h3>USA</h3>American wine has
							been produced since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in New Mexico
							in 1628. Today, wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing
							84% of all U.S. wine. The continent of North America is home to several native species of
							grape, including Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia, Vitis rotundifolia, and Vitis vulpina, but
							the wine-making industry is based almost entirely on the cultivation of the European Vitis
							vinifera, which was introduced by European settlers. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500
							km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine producing country in the
							world, after Italy, Spain, and France.<h3>California</h3>2021 vintage: "Unlike almost all
							other areas of the state, the Russian River Valley had higher than normal crops in 2021,
							which has made for a wine of greater generosity and fruit forwardness than some of its
							stablemates." - Morgan Twain-Peterson <h3>Napa Valley</h3><a target='_blank'
